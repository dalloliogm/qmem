=========================================================
ABOUT QMEM:

Qmem is a script designed to describe the memory usage of a
SGE cluster. If your cluster has memory restrictions, the
usage of qstat solely is not enough to monitor its state 
properly. Qmem attempts to solve that.





=========================================================
INSTALL:
In order to use qmem, your execution hosts must have 
configured "PER HOST" the following COMPLEX ATTIBUTES:
        slots = set to the host num of processors.
        h_vmem = set to the host total memory. Set to 
		CONSUMABLE
        local_disk = set to the host $TMPDIR partition size. 
		Set to CONSUMABLE

This is the default behaviour. If you want to use your 
custom variables, just change the names in the configuration 
section at the begining of the script. The slots and memory 
variables are mandatory to run qmem. The local_disk one is 
optional and you can run qmem without it.

Once you have configured these complex attributes in all 
hosts, you are ready to run qmem.





=========================================================
HOW TO USE IT:
qmem	Displays the memory usage of the cluster, one line
	per host

qmem -u Displays the memory usage of the cluster, node by 
	node and job by job. Lists all hosts and all jobs
	submitted to each host.
     -d Shows the real local disk usage on all the cluster
        nodes and jobs.




=========================================================
CHANGELOG:
        v0.2
        - Work by default with slots variable instead of 
	num_jobs.
        - Print host information (global and -u user 
	information) one by one as they are generated instead 
	of all at once at the end.
        - Read info of new consumable variable local_disk.
        - Added new parameter (-d) to report job and node 
	real disk usage (df/du).
        - Fixed host name sorting conflicts with Rocks-Cluster 
	(Thanks to Angel Carreno).
        - Added counter of running & suspended jobs at the 
	end of output (Thanks to Angel Carreno).
        - Fixed color coding escape problems in some terminals 
	(Thanks to Pablo Escobar for finding it and Jaime 
	Huerta for fixing it).


=========================================================
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
        Pablo Escobar: Find color-coding bug.
        Jaime Huerta: Fix color-coding bug.
        Angel Carreno: Fix proper sort of qhost.
                        Add suspended jobs counter
